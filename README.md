# Initialize the Application
To make the App work, you should run ```npm install``` in the directory of the project 
( using the CLI ) , in order to get the node_modules folder , and finally
```npm init -y``` getting the package.json


# Install the required libraries and run the Application in your localhost
First you have to register or login to __Formspree__
(in case you cannot use your own Back-end) and then create a new project called
'Cocktail Form' , once this is done , add the link that formspree will leave you
and add it to the action of the form in the __section Contact__ .
Once this is done you should install ```react-router-dom``` , ```styled-components``` and ```react-lottie```.
As a final step you need to run ```npm run start```, 
log into your favorite web browser and type __localhost:3000__ 
and you will be able to see the project!

# Other
__N.B__ 
I preferred to use my main language (Italian) for my first project,
however you can manually change the paragraphs by accessing the project! ðŸ˜‰
